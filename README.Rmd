The purpose of this analysis was to summarize the means and standard deviations of the metrics captured in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set within a tidy dataset. 

This README document outlines how the tidy dataset was produced from the original dataset. 

The analysis was executed in the following steps:

### Step 0: Downloaded original data

The original data was downloaded from the following URL and unzipped. <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>

### Step 1: Merged training and test datasets into a combined dataset

explain how this happened

### Step 2: Extracted only the variables which represent mean or standard deviation of the metrics.

explain how this happened

### Step 3: Recoded the activity levels with more descriptive labels

explain logic behind this

### Step 4: Renamed the variables to make them more descriptive and valid variable names within R.

### Step 5: Summarized the mean of these variables for each subject and activity within a tidy dataset.

To read the tidy dataset back into R, use the following code (assumes the tidy dataset exists in your working directory):

```{r}
read.csv()
```
