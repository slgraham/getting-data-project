The purpose of this analysis was to summarize the means and standard deviations of the feature measurements taken in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set within a tidy dataset. 

This README document outlines how the tidy dataset was produced from the original dataset. 

The analysis was executed in the following steps:

### Step 0: Downloaded original data

The original data was downloaded from the following URL and unzipped. <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>

### Step 1: Merged training and test datasets into a combined dataset

Created a combined dataset by first column-binding the X_*.txt (feature measurement variables), y_*.txt (activities variable), and subject_*.txt (subject list) together for each of the /test and /train directories, and then row-binding the resulting datasets together.

### Step 2: Extracted only the variables which represent mean or standard deviation of the metrics.

Only measurement variables with "mean()" or "std()" in the name were selected. 

### Step 3: Recoded the activity levels with more descriptive labels



### Step 4: Renamed the variables to make them more descriptive and valid variable names within R.

Original feature measurement variable names were taken from the ...
reference codebook

### Step 5: Summarized the mean of these variables for each subject and activity within a tidy dataset.

To download the dataset to your working directory and read it into R, use the following code:

```{r}
download.file("https://github.com/slgraham/getting-data-project/blob/master/tidy_data.txt", "tidy_data.txt", method = "curl")
df <- read.table("tidy_data.txt")
```
